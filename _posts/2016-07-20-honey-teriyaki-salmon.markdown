ingredients:
  - salmon
  - honey
  - teriyaki sauce
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 275°F.
  - Mix equal parts honey and teriyaki sauce relative to the size of the salmon (about ½ cup - ¾ cup each).
  - Pour the sauce over the raw salmon. If you don't care too much about presentation, poke holes in the salmon to help the flavor seep in. (It's better if you marinade the salmon for at least 30 minutes, but this is not necessary if you're in a hurry!)
  - Bake in a foil-lined pan for 18-25 minutes or until the salmon begins to flake when raked with a fork.
  - Broil on low for 2-5 minutes to give the salmon a glaze.
