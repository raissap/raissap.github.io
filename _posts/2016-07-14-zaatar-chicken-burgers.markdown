ingredients:
  - 10 oz ground chicken
  - 2 potato buns
  - 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
  - 1 lb yukon gold potatoes, sliced into ½-inch-thick sticks
  - ½ cucumber, small diced
  - ½ lemon, juiced
  - 2 tsp lemon zest
  - 1 bunch parsley, removed from stems and chopped
  - 1 bunch mint, removed from stems
  - 5 tbsp crumbled feta cheese
  - 1 tbsp za'atar
  - ¼ cup labneh cheese
  - salt
  - pepper
  - olive oil
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 475°F.
  - Place the potatoes on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper and toss to thoroughly coat. Arrange in a single, even layer and roast 22-24 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork.
  - In a medium pan, fry the garlic in a thin layer of oil on medium heat, stirring occasionally, 3-4 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly browned and crispy. Leaving the oil in the pan, transfer the garlic chips to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season with salt and pepper.
  - In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, lemon zest, parsley and za'atar. Season with salt and pepper. Gently mix to combine, then form into two ½-inch-thick patties. Heat the pan of reserved oil on medium-high heat until hot. Cook the patties, loosely covering the pan with foil, 3-4 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Transfer to a plate, leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan. Carefully discard the oil from the pan.
  - In a bowl, combine the cucumber, mint (finely chopping just before adding), and lemon juice. Drizzle with olive oil and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - In a bowl, combine the labneh and feta cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - Heat the pan of reserved fond on medium heat until hot. (If the pan seems dry, add 1 tsp of olive oil.) Add the buns, cut sides down and toast for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until lightly browned.
  - Assemble the burgers. Add the patties to the buns. Top with the labneh spread, some of the cucumber relish, and half the garlic chips.
  - Serve with the roasted potates and any remaining cucumber relish on the side. Garnish with the remaining garlic chips.
