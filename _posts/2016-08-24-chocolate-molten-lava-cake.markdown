ingredients:
  - 2 oz semi-sweet chocolate
  - ¼ cup butter
  - ½ cup powdered sugar
  - 1 large egg
  - 1 large egg yolk
  - 3 tbsp flour
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 425°F.
  - Grease two small ramekins and dust with a little bit of powdered sugar. Crisco works well.
  - Microwave the chocolate and butter in a medium microwaveable bowl for about 45 seconds or until the butter is melted. Whisk until the chocolate is completely melted.
  - Stir in the powdered sugar.
  - Add the egg and egg yolk. Mix well.
  - Stir in the flour.
  - Spoon the batter into the prepared cups and bake for 13 minutes or until the edges are firm, but the centers are still soft.
  - Let stand for 1 minute.
  - Carefully run a knife around the cakes to loosen. Invert onto dessert plates. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and top with ice cream or whipped cream (or both!).
