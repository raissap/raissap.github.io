ingredients:
  - 2 lbs uncooked Brussels sprouts, trimmed
  - 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
  - 2 tsp salt
  - ¼  tsp ground black pepper
  - ¼ tsp salt
  - 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
  - 2 tbsp maple syrup
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 450°F.
  - Line a large baking sheet with foil and coat with cooking spray.
  - Slice the Brussels sprouts in half, if large.
  - Toss the Brussels sprouts in the oil, 2 tsp of salt, and pepper until well coated.
  - Roast for about 20 minutes, stirring and rotating the pan halfway through cooking.
  - Meanwhile, combine the vinegar, maple syrup, and ¼ tsp salt in a small saucepan.
  - Bring to a boil on medium high heat, stirring frequently, until thick and syrupy (about 3 minutes). Do not cook for too long or the sauce can become sticky and hard!
  - Spoon the Brussels sprouts into a serving dish and drizzle with the syrup just before serving.
