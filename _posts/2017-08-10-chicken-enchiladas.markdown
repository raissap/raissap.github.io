ingredients:
  - 3 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
  - 1 can diced green chile peppers
  - 1 cup green salsa
  - 1 bell pepper
  - ½ cup fresh cilantro
  - 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
  - 2 tsp ground cumin
  - 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
  - salt and pepper to taste
  - ~6 (7inch) tortillas
  - enchilada sauce
  - ½ cup shredded cheese (type depends on what you like with your sauce)
instructions:
  - In a pressure cooker, combine the chicken breasts and about half of the green chile peppers and salsa. Fill with water until the liquid covers the chicken. Cook for about 15-20 minutes.
  - Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a large baking dish. Additionally, lining the dish with parchment paper can help prevent sticking.
  - Use a food processor and/or finely chop the bell pepper, cilantro, and chipotle peppers.
  - Remove the chicken from the water (save the water for flavored rice!) and shred it. A mixer does the job nicely.
  - Mix in the chopped veggies, cumin, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - Place the chicken along the edge of a tortilla and roll tightly into a tube. Place the enchilada, seam-side down, into the baking dish.
  - Pour your favorite enchilada sauce on top.
  - Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
  - Remove the foil, sprinkle with the remaining cheese, and bake until the cheese is completely melted, about 10 minutes.
